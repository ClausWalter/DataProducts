<p class="MsoNormal">The 3D-plot unites the 2D plot information in just one joint
plot. Please note that for this plot type, filter values are not taken into acccount,
so the values for all entries in mtcars are always displayed. However, you can still
zoom in and out within the plot directly.
Depending on the browser you use, graphical display might be a challenge.
It is recommended to use the Internet Explorer. If the plot does not get
displayed when you open the tab, please try moving your mouse over where the
plot should appear. Latest then, it should be displayed. By clicking on the
graph and moving the mouse cursor, the 3D-perspective can be moved around.<o:p></o:p></p>
