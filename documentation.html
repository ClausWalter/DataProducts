<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Data Basis:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The data used for this application is the R mtcars data set.
This data set relates several car attributes, e.g. weight (wt), horsepower (hp)
and displacement (disp.) to gas consumption resp. miles per gallon (MPG) for
certain types of cars. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Filtering Data:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">For the cars available in data frame «mtcars», in the
sidebar panel, several attributes can be chosen using a slide bar and radio
buttons. Based on these attributes, the cars fulfilling these values are
filtered. After filtering, the graphics, list of selected cars and statistics
displayed for the cars (see the according tabs) are updated accordingly. If no
car fulfills the filter criteria, no values are displayed.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>2D Plots:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In two tabs, 2D scatter diagrams are displayed, which show
for the various cars analyzed (see above) the relation between MPG vs. weight
respectively MPG vs. displacement. The colors display the number of cylinders,
the size of the data points gives an impression of the horse powers per data
point. Each data point symbolizes a car in the underlying data set. You can
hover over any data point, displaying the according values. If you click on
any, the value will be memorized in one of the text fields beneath the plots.
The second text field if displaying the value the mouse cursor is currently
hovering over. This feature migh be useful to compare two values in the plot.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>3D Plot:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The 3D-plot unites the 2D plot information in just one joint
plot. For technical reasons, the filter values cannot be applied here, so 
data displayed is always the full mtcars data set. However, within the plot,
you can use standard functionality for zooming in and out.
Depending on the browser you use, graphical display might be a challenge.
It is recommended to use the Internet Explorer. If the plot does not get
displayed when you open the tab, please try moving your mouse over where the
plot should appear. Latest then, it should be displayed. By clicking on the
graph and moving the mouse cursor, the 3D-perspective can be moved around.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>List of selected
Cars:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One of the tabs provides a list of the selected cars. Within
the list, which is based on standard Shiny functionality, you can navigate,
sort and filter using the fields with the according labels.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Stats for selected
Cars:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">For the selected cars, the average values for several
attributes (horse powers, weight etc.) are calculated and displayed. For some
values (e.g. transmission type), average calculation does not make sense, so
these values are not calculated.<o:p></o:p></p>
